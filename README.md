# Bagitify

Creates bagit archives of sensor data retrieved from ERDDAP.

## Usage

### To run from the command line:

First, set environment variables as necessary for thebagit metadata. Variables are as follows:

```
BAGIT_BAG_GROUP_IDENTIFIER
BAGIT_CONTACT_EMAIL
BAGIT_CONTACT_NAME
BAGIT_CONTACT_PHONE
BAGIT_ORGANIZATION_ADDRESS
BAGIT_SOURCE_ORGANIZATION
```

Any that are not set will default to emptry string in the metadata.

Bagitify supports multiple instances of any of these, accomplished by suffixing the variable names
with a string of your choice. A number or something descriptive of the reason for the duplication
probably makes the most sense, but it is basically arbitrary.

For example, setting both `BAGIT_CONTACT_PHONE` and `BAGIT_CONTACT_PHONE_2` would result in
two phone numbers being saved in the bagit metadata.

To actually call the program, run

```bash
./bagitify/bagitify.py [-d DIRECTORY] [-s START] [-e END] <tabledap_url>`
```

`-d` allows the user to specify the directory to create the bagit archive in. If not set,
the default is a directory in `./bagit_archives` with an autogenerated name like
`edu_usf_marine_comps_2022-05_2022-09_bagit` based on the tabledap url, start, and end dates.

`-s` and `-e` specify start and end dates. Expected datetime format is `%Y-%m-%d` or `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`.
For example, `2022-05-01` and `2022-05-01T00:00:00Z` are valid. If a start or end is not set, it defaults to
the start or end of the data in ERDDAP, repsectively. In any case, it will be internally
rounded to the first day of the month for the start, and the first day of the next month for the end.

Finally, `tabledap_url` is an ERDDAP tabledap url such as `https://erddap.secoora.org/erddap/tabledap/edu_usf_marine_comps_1407d550.html`

Putting it all together, bagitify might be run like so:

```bash
python bagitify/bagitify.py -s 2022-05-01 -e 2022-08-01 https://erddap.secoora.org/erddap/tabledap/edu_usf_marine_comps_1407d550.html
```

### Docker

The docker version works essentially the same way, though the variables will need to be set through the docker command,
and it will be important to bind mount the place it will be writing to so that you can get the results. For example: 

```
docker build -t bagitify .

docker run \
  -e BAGIT_BAG_GROUP_IDENTIFIER="bgi" \
  -e BAGIT_CONTACT_EMAIL="fake@email.address" \
  -e BAGIT_CONTACT_NAME="John Doe" \
  -e BAGIT_CONTACT_PHONE="(123) 456-7890" \
  -e BAGIT_ORGANIZATION_ADDRESS="123 Fake Street, Some Town, AK 12345" \
  -e BAGIT_SOURCE_ORGANIZATION="Fake Org" \
  -v ./ncei-archives:/srv/bagitify/bagit_archives \
  bagitify -s 2022-05-01 -e 2022-08-01 https://erddap.secoora.org/erddap/tabledap/edu_usf_marine_comps_1407d550.html
```

An example Docker Compose file is also provided in this repository at `docker-compose.yml`.
The mounted data directory must be writable by the user in the bagitify container,
which is user is 57439 by default but can be set via the `BAGITIFY_USER` environment variable.

Example to run using Docker Compose using your user id:

```
mkdir -p ./ncei-archives
BAGITIFY_USER=$(id -u) docker compose run bagitify
```

Environment variables can also be managed using `--env-file` in `docker run`.
